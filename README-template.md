## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've never really used the `hsl(..., ..., ...)` in CSS, before now, I've always used hexadecimal values or `rgba` in CSS. Seeing the `hsl`, I was excited to learn about it.

### Continued development

I'm not completely comfortable with semantic html markup. I'm deeming to learn and master it. Also, I have issue figuring out the right `font-size`, `margin`, `gap` and `padding` for my design, I had to use a trial-error method. Now, I think i've a method to approach this issue.
